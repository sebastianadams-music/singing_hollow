                <h2>How to listen to this music</h2>
                <p>This piece is part of an experimental music tradition that treats music and the world around us as intertwined. If you're not used to this, you might find it strange or even rude to leave during a performance or to come in after it has started: but this music is designed to be experienced in that way.</p>
                <p>If you only want to stay for thirty seconds, that's perfectly fine: it's possible to get a lot from something even if you only live it for an instant. Equally, you are welcome to stay for as long as you like.</p>
                <p>The way to get the most out of this piece is probably to move around gradually and listen in various different positions inside and around the church. I would recommend walking around aimlessly until you find yourself in a position where you think something interesting is happening, and then staying there until you're no longer interested: then repeat this process until you think you've heard everything you want to hear from the piece.</p>
                <p>The reason that listening in this way makes sense is that the piece is made up of many overlapping layers and structures: the idea is that no two people will have the same experience, because everybody will hear things from different times and different places. While there is structure here, which is all inspired by the way the bell ringers think about their music, it's all cyclical: there's no beginning, no middle and no end, and you shoudn't wait for something to happen in order to make sense of what you're hearing. If you do want to try and make sense of it, you could think of the music as a way of stimulating the church and its grounds, and placing them in the surroundings - a bit like the Singing Hollow sculpture in the church grounds.</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The **Singing Hollow** sculpture in St Audoen's Park invites visitors to put their heads into a hole inside a rock. It creates an acoustic transformation reminiscent of the feeling of sanctuary from the outside world that comes when you walk into a church. This inspired this live sound installation: organ plays inside the church, musicians play in the grounds, and church bells bridge both worlds, all playing parts that are both independent and interdependent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the original performance, the piece is designed for four outdoor instruments, six church bells (each one rung by an individual) and an organ. It was specifically written for St Audoen’s Church of Ireland, which is an incredibly old church.

                <p class="section-intro">
                    [named for] St Ouen (or Audoen) of Rouen (Normandy), a saint who lived in the seventh century and was dedicated to him by the Anglo-Normans, who arrived in Dublin after 1172. It was erected in 1190, possibly on the site of an older church dedicated to St. Columcille.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Audoen%27s_Church,_Dublin_(Church_of_Ireland)">¹</a>.
                <p>
                    Three of the bells in this church are over 600 years old.
