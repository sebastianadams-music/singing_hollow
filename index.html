                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Singing Hollow sculpture in St Audoen's Park invites visitors to put their heads into a hole inside a rock. It creates an acoustic transformation reminiscent of the feeling of sanctuary from the outside world that comes when you walk into a church. This inspired this live sound installation: organ plays inside the church, musicians play in the grounds, and church bells bridge both worlds, all playing parts that are both independent and interdependent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the original performance, the piece is designed for four outdoor instruments, six church bells (each one rung by an individual) and an organ. It was specifically written for St Audoen’s Church of Ireland, which is an incredibly old church.
                </p>
                <p class="section-intro">
                    [named for] St Ouen (or Audoen) of Rouen (Normandy), a saint who lived in the seventh century and was dedicated to him by the Anglo-Normans, who arrived in Dublin after 1172. It was erected in 1190, possibly on the site of an older church dedicated to St. Columcille.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Audoen%27s_Church,_Dublin_(Church_of_Ireland)">¹</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three of the bells in this church are over 600 years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The piece could easily be adapted for performance in other circumstances: a different church, a different number of bells, a different number of outdoor instrumentalists. The main thing which would need to be redone from scratch is the division of the church grounds into areas and sectors outlined in Spatial Layer - structural.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The organ and outdoor instrumental parts are derived from the bells in various ways explained later in this score.
